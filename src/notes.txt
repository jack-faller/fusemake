a file is out of date if:
- it is missing
- it has a dependency newer than its age

unopened directories are only out of date if they are erased
should also track inverse dependencies (for files and directories which don't exist)

to simplify the build process, remove out of date files at the start
only remove out of date files if they are part of the current build targets
should be an option to remove all out of date files

todo: automatically handle fuseless builds when fusermount not available
