Usage: fusemake <options> [--] <targets>
  Build the listed targets incrementally. If no targets are supplied, read them
from standard input one line at a time.
  Dependency information about build products is determined by using a fuse
file-system to track which files are accessed by the build process. The script
assigned to builder upon initialisation is expected to take the name of the
desired build product (which could be a directory) as its soul argument. The
script will be executed in a copy of the project root directory that passes
through requests to the base file system. Only reads and writes made through
this directory are logged.
  $FUSEMAKE_NO_DEPEND is set to the full path of the project root. Accesses made
through this path cannot be tracked by FuseMake and will therefore not cause
rebuilds when changes are made to the dependency.

Options:
--version           Display compiler version information.
--processes <count> Allow approximately count build processes. Defaults to the
                    number of processors on the device.
--builder <builder> Use the program builder for building. Must be specified if
                    not already in a build process.
--null              Delimit files on standard input with null bytes.
